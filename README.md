# RCV_Project

Welcome to my project where I set out to learn new skills that surround machine learning, large language models, risk based models and financial trading algorithms.

Algo_1 - ML model to predict the price of the NASDAQ Compesite. (In progress)

Algo_2 - LLM based on Qwen that has been adjusted and trained on essays and documents I have written. (In progress)

Algo_3 - Risk model deigned to find the most likely to fail in set of derivatives. (In progress)
